# Percent

Percent is a microtask management platform that allows people to practice and learn new skills, while actually producing value for companies. Percent's aim is to fill the gap between internships and employment by letting students learn new skills while doing actual micro tasks for companies. Which in turn allows companies to test the new hires with the most accurate metric on the market: real job done.

## What we have achieved and our plans?
This repository currently serves as a prototype to show how Percent will look and feel like when it is completed.
The project uses **Angular Framework** and runs on **AWS Amplify**. The backend is currently being developed with **AWS RDS**, **AWS Lambda**, **AWS Cognito**.
